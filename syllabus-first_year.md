# Learning plan

## Week 1

### Google effectively

- Attend the session by seniors.
- Go through this blog post on [Advanced search tips](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-advanced-search-tips).

### Install Linux

- The latest LTE version of Ubuntu is suggested.
- Backup all important data to a usb hardrive or usb flashdrive.
- If you fail the first time, try again.

Note: Please don't ask others to install Ubuntu for you. The purpose for this task is for you to learn how to install an OS.

### Learn linux commands

The best way to learn linux commands is not to use the UI or the mouse to do things. For example:

- Use the `cp` command to copy a file or folder to a usb.
- Use the `cat` command to see the content of a file.

### Setup your system

Ubuntu out of the box will have most of the things that you need, but learn to install new software using `apt` and `dpkg` command. Suggestions on some software that would be useful:

- Atom editor: Use this for editing programs.
- VLC: To open video or music files.
- Google Chrome: (FireFox will be available by default).
- Telegram: (Because we have our FOSS group in Telegram.)
- Zsh and Oh-My-Zsh: To make your terminal better.

## Week 2

### Learn a new Language

A recommended language to start with would be Python. Go through the `Learn the Basics` section from [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/).

Note: Only go though the basics, no need to go through the data science or advanced topics.
